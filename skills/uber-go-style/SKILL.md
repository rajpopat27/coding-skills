description: Agent-ready Uber Go style guide. Use when writing, reviewing, or modifying Go code to apply practical best practices for APIs, interfaces, errors, concurrency, data ownership, initialization, globals, naming, imports, tests, performance, linting, and idiomatic Go style. Use for implementation, refactoring, bug fixing, and code review when an agent needs concrete good/bad guidance without loading the full upstream guide.

# Uber Go Style

## Operating Mode

Use this skill as an agent-ready Go coding standard based on the Uber Go Style Guide. It is intentionally not a copy of `style.md`: it condenses the guide into decisions an agent can apply while coding or reviewing, with concrete bad/good rewrite patterns for the traps that most often cause bugs or noisy reviews.

Before changing code:

1. Inspect `go.mod`, package layout, nearby files, tests, and lint configuration.
2. Prefer consistent local convention when it is deliberate and does not hide bugs.
3. Use this skill to decide what good looks like, what bad looks like, and how to rewrite.
4. Read `references/src/*.md` only when exact upstream examples or nuance are needed.
5. After edits, run `gofmt` or `go fmt`; use `goimports` if imports changed and it exists.
6. Run focused tests first; run broader tests when shared behavior, APIs, or concurrency changed.

## Priority Order

When guidance conflicts, prefer this order:

1. Correct behavior and clear failure modes.
2. Stable, unsurprising package APIs.
3. Safe ownership of slices, maps, goroutines, locks, and globals.
4. Explicit error handling with useful context.
5. Readable, idiomatic Go that follows local conventions.
6. Performance improvements with clear evidence or obvious low cost.
7. Cosmetic style cleanup only when it helps the current change.

Do not create review churn. Fix code near the task. Leave unrelated large rewrites alone.

## Fast Review Checklist

- Interfaces are values, not `*interface`.
- Important interface contracts are asserted with `var _ Interface = (*Type)(nil)`.
- Errors are handled once, wrapped with useful context, and not both logged and returned.
- Goroutines have cancellation, ownership, and a wait or shutdown path.
- Slices and maps are copied when crossing ownership boundaries.
- `sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex` are named fields, not embedded and not allocated with `new`.
- Public structs do not embed implementation details accidentally.
- `init` avoids I/O, hidden ordering, goroutines, and mutable global setup.
- Libraries return errors instead of calling `os.Exit`, `log.Fatal`, or `panic`.
- Imports are grouped and names do not shadow built-ins.
- Tests cover changed behavior and edge cases, preferably table-driven when cases repeat.
- Hot paths avoid obvious allocation waste such as repeated conversions and missing capacity.

## Interfaces and APIs

Good Go APIs are small, explicit, and easy for callers to evolve with.

Use interfaces at the consumer boundary. Define an interface where it is used unless it is a stable public contract. Avoid exporting abstractions before there are real callers.

Never use a pointer to an interface. An interface value already contains type information and a data pointer. If the dynamic value needs mutation, the concrete value stored in the interface can be a pointer.

Bad:

```go
func Decode(r *io.Reader) error
```

Good:

```go
func Decode(r io.Reader) error
```

Verify interface compliance when a type must satisfy an API contract:

```go
var _ http.Handler = (*Handler)(nil)
```

Use the zero value on the right-hand side: `(*T)(nil)` for pointer receivers, `T{}` for value receivers, `nil` for slices and maps.

Choose receivers deliberately:

- Use pointer receivers when the method mutates the receiver, avoids copying large structs, or needs a consistent method set.
- Use value receivers for small immutable values where copying is expected.
- Avoid mixing pointer and value receivers for the same type unless there is a clear reason.

Avoid embedding types in public structs unless exposing the embedded type is truly part of the public API. Public embedding leaks methods and fields and makes future changes harder.

Bad:

```go
type Client struct {
    *http.Client
}
```

Good:

```go
type Client struct {
    httpClient *http.Client
}
```

Use functional options for constructors with several optional settings, especially when the option set may grow. Keep required values as explicit constructor parameters.

## Errors and Failure Behavior
Errors should tell the caller what failed and preserve matching when matching is useful.

Use:

- `errors.New` for static errors.
- `fmt.Errorf` for dynamic errors.
- `%w` when callers should be able to match or unwrap the cause.
- `%v` when the lower-level error should be opaque.
- `ErrFoo` for exported sentinel errors.
- `errFoo` for unexported package errors.
- `FooError` for custom error types.

Bad:

```go
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to create new store: %w", err)
}
```

Good:

```go
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("new store: %w", err)
}
```

Handle errors once. Either wrap and return, or log and degrade gracefully. Do not log and return the same error unless duplicate reporting is explicitly desired.

Bad:

```go
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("read config: %v", err)
    return err
}
```

Good:

```go
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("read config: %w", err)
}
```

Always use comma-ok type assertions unless a panic is truly the desired behavior:

```go
v, ok := x.(string)
if !ok {
    return fmt.Errorf("expected string, got %T", x)
}
```

Do not panic in production control flow. Return errors. In tests, use `t.Fatal` or `require.NoError` instead of `panic`. `template.Must` and similar initialization helpers are acceptable when failure means the program cannot start.

Only `main` should call `os.Exit` or `log.Fatal`. Prefer:

```go
func main() {
    if err := run(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}

func run() error {
    // testable work
    return nil
}
```

## Concurrency

Every goroutine needs an owner and a way to stop. If code starts background work, the API should expose cancellation, `Close`, `Shutdown`, a returned channel, or a wait path.

Bad:

```go
go func() {
    for item := range ch {
        process(item)
    }
}()
```

Good:

```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Add(1)
go func() {
    defer wg.Done()
    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return
        case item, ok := <-ch:
            if !ok {
                return
            }
            process(item)
        }
    }
}()
```

Prefer unbuffered channels or size one. Larger buffers need a specific reason, such as known bounded work or documented throughput behavior.

Use zero-value `sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex`. Do not allocate locks with `new`. Do not embed locks in structs because embedding exposes lock methods as part of the struct API.

Bad:

```go
type Cache struct {
    sync.Mutex
    items map[string]Item
}
```

Good:

```go
type Cache struct {
    mu    sync.Mutex
    items map[string]Item
}
```

Prefer typed atomics such as `go.uber.org/atomic` when the project already accepts that dependency. Otherwise follow local atomic conventions.

Do not start goroutines from `init`. Startup, shutdown, and error handling should be explicit.

## Data Ownership

Slices and maps share backing data. Copy them when ownership crosses package or component boundaries.

Copy inputs you store:

```go
func NewConfig(hosts []string) Config {
    return Config{hosts: append([]string(nil), hosts...)}
}
```

Copy internal state you return:

```go
func (c *Config) Hosts() []string {
    return append([]string(nil), c.hosts...)
}
```

Use nil slices as the default empty slice unless encoding semantics require `[]`. Check emptiness with `len(s) == 0`.

Preallocate when size is known:

```go
out := make([]User, 0, len(ids))
```

Initialize structs with field names, especially across package boundaries.

Bad:

```go
addr := net.TCPAddr{"127.0.0.1", 8080, ""}
```

Good:

```go
addr := net.TCPAddr{
    IP:   net.ParseIP("127.0.0.1"),
    Port: 8080,
}
```

Use `var s T` for a zero-value struct. Use `&T{Field: value}` instead of `new(T)` when setting fields.

Start enum-like constants at one when zero should mean unset or invalid:

```go
const (
    StatusUnknown Status = iota
    StatusReady
    StatusFailed
)
```

## Initialization and Globals

Avoid `init`. It hides order, errors, global state mutation, and test setup. If it is unavoidable, keep it deterministic, fast, and free of I/O and goroutines.

Avoid mutable package globals. Prefer constructor injection:

Bad:

```go
var db *sql.DB
```

Good:

```go
type Store struct {
    db *sql.DB
}
```

Immutable package values are fine. Mutable shared state needs explicit ownership and synchronization.

## Naming, Imports, and File Shape

Package names should be lowercase, short, and meaningful. Avoid `common`, `util`, `shared`, `base`, and `lib` unless the codebase already has a very clear convention.

Use `MixedCaps`, not underscores, for normal Go names. Test names may use underscores to group scenarios.

Avoid shadowing predeclared identifiers:

Bad:

```go
var error string
func copy(dst, src []byte) {}
```

Good:

```go
var errorMessage string
func copyBytes(dst, src []byte) {}
```

Use import aliases only when the package name differs from the last path element, there is a conflict, or a convention requires it.

Group imports:

```go
import (
    "context"
    "fmt"

    "go.uber.org/zap"
)
```

Order files so readers can scan them: public types and constructors first, methods grouped by receiver, helpers later. Put `NewType` near `Type`.

Use early returns to reduce nesting. Remove unnecessary `else` after `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `panic`.

Bad:

```go
if err != nil {
    return err
} else {
    return nil
}
```

Good:

```go
if err != nil {
    return err
}
return nil
```

Avoid naked boolean parameters in public or unclear APIs. Use named option structs, custom types, or comments for local obvious calls.

## Time, Tags, and Strings

Use `time.Time` for instants and `time.Duration` for periods. If a duration cannot use `time.Duration`, include the unit in the name, such as `timeoutMillis`.

Use RFC 3339 for timestamp strings unless another protocol requires something else.

Use field tags for marshaled structs:

```go
type Product struct {
    PriceCents int64 `json:"price_cents"`
}
```

Use raw string literals when escaping makes normal strings hard to read.

Declare format strings as constants when it helps `go vet` inspect printf-style usage. Name printf-style helpers with an `f` suffix, such as `Wrapf`.

## Performance Defaults

Prefer simple code until the path is plausibly hot or the waste is obvious. Good low-risk defaults:

- Use `strconv` for primitive-to-string conversion instead of `fmt`.
- Avoid repeated `string` to `[]byte` conversion for fixed values.
- Preallocate slices and maps when size is known.
- Avoid unnecessary allocation from pointer-heavy APIs when values are small and immutable.

Bad:

```go
for _, n := range nums {
    s = append(s, fmt.Sprint(n))
}
```

Good:

```go
for _, n := range nums {
    s = append(s, strconv.Itoa(n))
}
```

Do not trade readability for performance unless there is a benchmark, profile, or clear hot path.

## Tests

Use table-driven tests when cases share setup or assertions. Use subtests for readable failure output.

Good pattern:

```go
func TestParse(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        give    string
        want    Value
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {name: "empty", give: "", wantErr: true},
        {name: "valid", give: "42", want: Value{N: 42}},
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        tt := tt
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := Parse(tt.give)
            if tt.wantErr {
                if err == nil {
                    t.Fatal("expected error")
                }
                return
            }
            if err != nil {
                t.Fatalf("unexpected error: %v", err)
            }
            if got != tt.want {
                t.Fatalf("got %v, want %v", got, tt.want)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

Avoid complex branching inside table tests. Split tests when each case needs a different scenario or setup. For parallel subtests, capture loop variables.

Test observable behavior rather than private implementation details. Cover error paths, boundary values, cancellation, ownership copies, and public API guarantees. Use the repository's existing assertion library if it already has one; otherwise standard `testing` is enough.

## Code Review Behavior

When reviewing, lead with correctness and maintainability findings. A good finding says what can break, where, why, and how to fix it.

Prioritize:

- Data races or goroutine leaks.
- Lost, double-logged, or unmatchable errors.
- Caller mutation through slices or maps.
- Public API choices that are hard to evolve.
- Hidden startup behavior from `init` or globals.
- Missing tests for behavior that changed.
- Performance issues in loops or hot paths with clear fixes.

Do not flood the review with style nits. Mention style only when it affects readability, consistency, linting, or future maintenance.

## Expanded Source Guidance

The following sections inline the most useful source details from `references/src/` and the upstream `style.md` structure. Use them for concrete rationale and Bad/Good examples during normal agent work. The remaining split files stay available for less common rules.

<!-- Source: references/src/interface-compliance.md -->

### Verify Interface Compliance

Verify interface compliance at compile time where appropriate. This includes:

- Exported types that are required to implement specific interfaces as part of
  their API contract
- Exported or unexported types that are part of a collection of types
  implementing the same interface
- Other cases where violating an interface would break users

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
type Handler struct {
  // ...
}



func (h *Handler) ServeHTTP(
  w http.ResponseWriter,
  r *http.Request,
) {
  ...
}
```

</td><td>

```go
type Handler struct {
  // ...
}

var _ http.Handler = (*Handler)(nil)

func (h *Handler) ServeHTTP(
  w http.ResponseWriter,
  r *http.Request,
) {
  // ...
}
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

The statement `var _ http.Handler = (*Handler)(nil)` will fail to compile if
`*Handler` ever stops matching the `http.Handler` interface.

The right hand side of the assignment should be the zero value of the asserted
type. This is `nil` for pointer types (like `*Handler`), slices, and maps, and
an empty struct for struct types.

```go
type LogHandler struct {
  h   http.Handler
  log *zap.Logger
}

var _ http.Handler = LogHandler{}

func (h LogHandler) ServeHTTP(
  w http.ResponseWriter,
  r *http.Request,
) {
  // ...
}
```

<!-- Source: references/src/interface-receiver.md -->

### Receivers and Interfaces

Methods with value receivers can be called on pointers as well as values.
Methods with pointer receivers can only be called on pointers or [addressable values].

  [addressable values]: https://go.dev/ref/spec#Method_values

For example,

```go
type S struct {
  data string
}

func (s S) Read() string {
  return s.data
}

func (s *S) Write(str string) {
  s.data = str
}

// We cannot get pointers to values stored in maps, because they are not
// addressable values.
sVals := map[int]S{1: {"A"}}

// We can call Read on values stored in the map because Read
// has a value receiver, which does not require the value to
// be addressable.
sVals[1].Read()

// We cannot call Write on values stored in the map because Write
// has a pointer receiver, and it's not possible to get a pointer
// to a value stored in a map.
//
//  sVals[1].Write("test")

sPtrs := map[int]*S{1: {"A"}}

// You can call both Read and Write if the map stores pointers,
// because pointers are intrinsically addressable.
sPtrs[1].Read()
sPtrs[1].Write("test")
```

Similarly, an interface can be satisfied by a pointer, even if the method has a
value receiver.

```go
type F interface {
  f()
}

type S1 struct{}

func (s S1) f() {}

type S2 struct{}

func (s *S2) f() {}

s1Val := S1{}
s1Ptr := &S1{}
s2Val := S2{}
s2Ptr := &S2{}

var i F
i = s1Val
i = s1Ptr
i = s2Ptr

// The following doesn't compile, since s2Val is a value, and there is no value receiver for f.
//   i = s2Val
```

Effective Go has a good write up on [Pointers vs. Values].

  [Pointers vs. Values]: https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#pointers_vs_values

<!-- Source: references/src/mutex-zero-value.md -->

### Zero-value Mutexes are Valid

The zero-value of `sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex` is valid, so you almost
never need a pointer to a mutex.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>

<tr><td>

```go
mu := new(sync.Mutex)
mu.Lock()
```

</td><td>

```go
var mu sync.Mutex
mu.Lock()
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

If you use a struct by pointer, then the mutex should be a non-pointer field on
it. Do not embed the mutex on the struct, even if the struct is not exported.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>

<tr><td>

```go
type SMap struct {
  sync.Mutex

  data map[string]string

func NewSMap() *SMap {

func (m *SMap) Get(k string) string {
  m.Lock()

}

func (m *SMap) Get(k string) string {
  m.mu.Lock()
  defer m.mu.Unlock()

  return m.data[k]
}
```

</td></tr>

<tr><td>

The `Mutex` field, and the `Lock` and `Unlock` methods are unintentionally part
of the exported API of `SMap`.

The mutex and its methods are implementation details of `SMap` hidden from its
callers.

### Copy Slices and Maps at Boundaries

Slices and maps contain pointers to the underlying data so be wary of scenarios
when they need to be copied.

#### Receiving Slices and Maps

Keep in mind that users can modify a map or slice you received as an argument
if you store a reference to it.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th> <th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>

```go
func (d *Driver) SetTrips(trips []Trip) {
  d.trips = trips
}

trips := ...
d1.SetTrips(trips)

// Did you mean to modify d1.trips?
trips[0] = ...
```

</td>
<td>

```go
func (d *Driver) SetTrips(trips []Trip) {
  d.trips = make([]Trip, len(trips))
  copy(d.trips, trips)
}

trips := ...
d1.SetTrips(trips)

// We can now modify trips[0] without affecting d1.trips.
trips[0] = ...
```

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>

#### Returning Slices and Maps

Similarly, be wary of user modifications to maps or slices exposing internal
state.

<table>

  defer s.mu.Unlock()

  return s.counters

// snapshot is no longer protected by the mutex, so any
// access to the snapshot is subject to data races.
snapshot := stats.Snapshot()
```

```go
type Stats struct {

// Snapshot is now a copy.

<!-- Source: references/src/time.md -->

### Use `"time"` to handle time

Time is complicated. Incorrect assumptions often made about time include the
following.

1. A day has 24 hours
2. An hour has 60 minutes
3. A week has 7 days
4. A year has 365 days
5. [And a lot more](https://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time)

For example, *1* means that adding 24 hours to a time instant will not always
yield a new calendar day.

Therefore, always use the [`"time"`] package when dealing with time because it
helps deal with these incorrect assumptions in a safer, more accurate manner.

  [`"time"`]: https://pkg.go.dev/time

#### Use `time.Time` for instants of time

Use [`time.Time`] when dealing with instants of time, and the methods on
`time.Time` when comparing, adding, or subtracting time.

  [`time.Time`]: https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
func isActive(now, start, stop int) bool {
  return start <= now && now < stop
}
```

</td><td>

```go
func isActive(now, start, stop time.Time) bool {
  return (start.Before(now) || start.Equal(now)) && now.Before(stop)
}
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

#### Use `time.Duration` for periods of time

Use [`time.Duration`] when dealing with periods of time.

  [`time.Duration`]: https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
func poll(delay int) {
  for {
    // ...
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(delay) * time.Millisecond)
  }
}

poll(10) // was it seconds or milliseconds?
```

</td><td>

```go
func poll(delay time.Duration) {
  for {
    // ...
    time.Sleep(delay)
  }
}

poll(10*time.Second)
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Going back to the example of adding 24 hours to a time instant, the method we
use to add time depends on intent. If we want the same time of the day, but on
the next calendar day, we should use [`Time.AddDate`]. However, if we want an
instant of time guaranteed to be 24 hours after the previous time, we should
use [`Time.Add`].

  [`Time.AddDate`]: https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.AddDate
  [`Time.Add`]: https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.Add

```go
newDay := t.AddDate(0 /* years */, 0 /* months */, 1 /* days */)
maybeNewDay := t.Add(24 * time.Hour)
```

#### Use `time.Time` and `time.Duration` with external systems

Use `time.Duration` and `time.Time` in interactions with external systems when
possible. For example:

- Command-line flags: [`flag`] supports `time.Duration` via
  [`time.ParseDuration`]
- JSON: [`encoding/json`] supports encoding `time.Time` as an [RFC 3339]
  string via its [`UnmarshalJSON` method]
- SQL: [`database/sql`] supports converting `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP` columns
  into `time.Time` and back if the underlying driver supports it
- YAML: [`gopkg.in/yaml.v2`] supports `time.Time` as an [RFC 3339] string, and
  `time.Duration` via [`time.ParseDuration`].

  [`flag`]: https://pkg.go.dev/flag
  [`time.ParseDuration`]: https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration
  [`encoding/json`]: https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json
  [RFC 3339]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339
  [`UnmarshalJSON` method]: https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.UnmarshalJSON
  [`database/sql`]: https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql
  [`gopkg.in/yaml.v2`]: https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v2

When it is not possible to use `time.Duration` in these interactions, use
`int` or `float64` and include the unit in the name of the field.

For example, since `encoding/json` does not support `time.Duration`, the unit
is included in the name of the field.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
// {"interval": 2}
type Config struct {
  Interval int `json:"interval"`
}
```

</td><td>

```go
// {"intervalMillis": 2000}
type Config struct {
  IntervalMillis int `json:"intervalMillis"`
}
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

When it is not possible to use `time.Time` in these interactions, unless an
alternative is agreed upon, use `string` and format timestamps as defined in
[RFC 3339]. This format is used by default by [`Time.UnmarshalText`] and is
available for use in `Time.Format` and `time.Parse` via [`time.RFC3339`].

  [`Time.UnmarshalText`]: https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.UnmarshalText
  [`time.RFC3339`]: https://pkg.go.dev/time#RFC3339

Although this tends to not be a problem in practice, keep in mind that the
`"time"` package does not support parsing timestamps with leap seconds
([8728]), nor does it account for leap seconds in calculations ([15190]). If
you compare two instants of time, the difference will not include the leap
seconds that may have occurred between those two instants.

<!-- Source: references/src/error-type.md -->

### Error Types

There are few options for declaring errors.
Consider the following before picking the option best suited for your use case.

- Does the caller need to match the error so that they can handle it?
  If yes, we must support the [`errors.Is`] or [`errors.As`] functions
  by declaring a top-level error variable or a custom type.
- Is the error message a static string,
  or is it a dynamic string that requires contextual information?
  For the former, we can use [`errors.New`], but for the latter we must
  use [`fmt.Errorf`] or a custom error type.

For example,
use [`errors.New`] for an error with a static string.
Export this error as a variable to support matching it with `errors.Is`
if the caller needs to match and handle this error.

Note that if you export error variables or types from a package,
they will become part of the public API of the package.

<!-- Source: references/src/error-wrap.md -->

### Error Wrapping

There are three main options for propagating errors if a call fails:

- return the original error as-is
- add context with `fmt.Errorf` and the `%w` verb
- add context with `fmt.Errorf` and the `%v` verb

Return the original error as-is if there is no additional context to add.
This maintains the original error type and message.
This is well suited for cases when the underlying error message
has sufficient information to track down where it came from.

Otherwise, add context to the error message where possible
so that instead of a vague error such as "connection refused",
you get more useful errors such as "call service foo: connection refused".

Use `fmt.Errorf` to add context to your errors,
picking between the `%w` or `%v` verbs
based on whether the caller should be able to
match and extract the underlying cause.

- Use `%w` if the caller should have access to the underlying error.
  This is a good default for most wrapped errors,
  but be aware that callers may begin to rely on this behavior.
  So for cases where the wrapped error is a known `var` or type,
  document and test it as part of your function's contract.
- Use `%v` to obfuscate the underlying error.
  Callers will be unable to match it,
  but you can switch to `%w` in the future if needed.

When adding context to returned errors, keep the context succinct by avoiding
phrases like "failed to", which state the obvious and pile up as the error
percolates up through the stack:

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
s, err := store.New()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf(
        "failed to create new store: %w", err)
}
```

</td><td>

```go
s, err := store.New()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf(
        "new store: %w", err)
}
```

</td></tr><tr><td>

```plain
failed to x: failed to y: failed to create new store: the error
```

</td><td>

```plain
x: y: new store: the error
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

However once the error is sent to another system, it should be clear the
message is an error (e.g. an `err` tag or "Failed" prefix in logs).

See also [Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully].

<!-- Source: references/src/error-once.md -->

### Handle Errors Once

When a caller receives an error from a callee,
it can handle it in a variety of different ways
depending on what it knows about the error.

These include, but not are limited to:

- if the callee contract defines specific errors,
  matching the error with `errors.Is` or `errors.As`
  and handling the branches differently
- if the error is recoverable,
  logging the error and degrading gracefully
- if the error represents a domain-specific failure condition,
  returning a well-defined error
- returning the error, either [wrapped](error-wrap.md) or verbatim

Regardless of how the caller handles the error,
it should typically handle each error only once.
The caller should not, for example, log the error and then return it,
because *its* callers may handle the error as well.

For example, consider the following cases:

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>Code</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

**Bad**: Log the error and return it

Callers further up the stack will likely take a similar action with the error.
Doing so makes a lot of noise in the application logs for little value.

</td><td>

```go
u, err := getUser(id)
if err != nil {
  // BAD: See description
  log.Printf("Could not get user %q: %v", id, err)
  return err
}
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

**Good**: Wrap the error and return it

Callers further up the stack will handle the error.
Use of `%w` ensures they can match the error with `errors.Is` or `errors.As`
if relevant.

</td><td>

```go
u, err := getUser(id)
if err != nil {
  return fmt.Errorf("get user %q: %w", id, err)
}
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

**Good**: Log the error and degrade gracefully

If the operation isn't strictly necessary,
we can provide a degraded but unbroken experience
by recovering from it.

</td><td>

```go
if err := emitMetrics(); err != nil {
  // Failure to write metrics should not
  // break the application.
  log.Printf("Could not emit metrics: %v", err)
}

```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

**Good**: Match the error and degrade gracefully

If the callee defines a specific error in its contract,
and the failure is recoverable,
match on that error case and degrade gracefully.
For all other cases, wrap the error and return it.

Callers further up the stack will handle other errors.

</td><td>

```go
tz, err := getUserTimeZone(id)
if err != nil {
  if errors.Is(err, ErrUserNotFound) {
    // User doesn't exist. Use UTC.
    tz = time.UTC
  } else {
    return fmt.Errorf("get user %q: %w", id, err)
  }
}
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<!-- Source: references/src/panic.md -->

### Don't Panic

Code running in production must avoid panics. Panics are a major source of
[cascading failures]. If an error occurs, the function must return an error and
allow the caller to decide how to handle it.

  [cascading failures]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_failure

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
func run(args []string) {
  if len(args) == 0 {
    panic("an argument is required")
  }
  // ...
}

func main() {
  run(os.Args[1:])
}
```

</td><td>

```go
func run(args []string) error {
  if len(args) == 0 {
    return errors.New("an argument is required")
  }
  // ...
  return nil
}

func main() {
  if err := run(os.Args[1:]); err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
    os.Exit(1)
  }
}
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Panic/recover is not an error handling strategy. A program must panic only when
something irrecoverable happens such as a nil dereference. An exception to this is
program initialization: bad things at program startup that should abort the
program may cause panic.

```go
var _statusTemplate = template.Must(template.New("name").Parse("_statusHTML"))
```

Even in tests, prefer `t.Fatal` or `t.FailNow` over panics to ensure that the
test is marked as failed.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
// func TestFoo(t *testing.T)

f, err := os.CreateTemp("", "test")
if err != nil {
  panic("failed to set up test")
}
```

</td><td>

```go
// func TestFoo(t *testing.T)

f, err := os.CreateTemp("", "test")
if err != nil {
  t.Fatal("failed to set up test")
}
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<!-- Source: references/src/init.md -->

### Avoid `init()`

Avoid `init()` where possible. When `init()` is unavoidable or desirable, code
should attempt to:

1. Be completely deterministic, regardless of program environment or invocation.
2. Avoid depending on the ordering or side-effects of other `init()` functions.
   While `init()` ordering is well-known, code can change, and thus
   relationships between `init()` functions can make code brittle and
   error-prone.
3. Avoid accessing or manipulating global or environment state, such as machine
   information, environment variables, working directory, program
   arguments/inputs, etc.
4. Avoid I/O, including both filesystem, network, and system calls.

Code that cannot satisfy these requirements likely belongs as a helper to be
called as part of `main()` (or elsewhere in a program's lifecycle), or be
written as part of `main()` itself. In particular, libraries that are intended
to be used by other programs should take special care to be completely
deterministic and not perform "init magic".

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
type Foo struct {
    // ...
}

var _defaultFoo Foo

func init() {
    _defaultFoo = Foo{
        // ...
    }
}
```

</td><td>

```go
var _defaultFoo = Foo{
    // ...
}

// or, better, for testability:

var _defaultFoo = defaultFoo()

func defaultFoo() Foo {
    return Foo{
        // ...
    }
}
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

```go
type Config struct {
    // ...
}

var _config Config

func init() {
    // Bad: based on current directory
    cwd, _ := os.Getwd()

    // Bad: I/O
    raw, _ := os.ReadFile(
        path.Join(cwd, "config", "config.yaml"),
    )

    yaml.Unmarshal(raw, &_config)
}
```

</td><td>

```go
type Config struct {
    // ...
}

func loadConfig() Config {
    cwd, err := os.Getwd()
    // handle err

    raw, err := os.ReadFile(
        path.Join(cwd, "config", "config.yaml"),
    )
    // handle err

    var config Config
    yaml.Unmarshal(raw, &config)

    return config
}
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Considering the above, some situations in which `init()` may be preferable or
necessary might include:

- Complex expressions that cannot be represented as single assignments.
- Pluggable hooks, such as `database/sql` dialects, encoding type registries, etc.
- Optimizations to [Google Cloud Functions] and other forms of deterministic
  precomputation.

<!-- Source: references/src/goroutine-forget.md -->

### Don't fire-and-forget goroutines

Goroutines are lightweight, but they're not free:
at minimum, they cost memory for their stack and CPU to be scheduled.
While these costs are small for typical uses of goroutines,
they can cause significant performance issues
when spawned in large numbers without controlled lifetimes.
Goroutines with unmanaged lifetimes can also cause other issues
like preventing unused objects from being garbage collected
and holding onto resources that are otherwise no longer used.

Therefore, do not leak goroutines in production code.
Use [go.uber.org/goleak](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/goleak)
to test for goroutine leaks inside packages that may spawn goroutines.

In general, every goroutine:

- must have a predictable time at which it will stop running; or
- there must be a way to signal to the goroutine that it should stop

In both cases, there must be a way for code to block and wait for the goroutine to
finish.

For example:

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
go func() {
  for {
    flush()
    time.Sleep(delay)
  }
}()
```

</td><td>

```go
var (
  stop = make(chan struct{}) // tells the goroutine to stop
  done = make(chan struct{}) // tells us that the goroutine exited
)
go func() {
  defer close(done)

  ticker := time.NewTicker(delay)
  defer ticker.Stop()
  for {
    select {
    case <-ticker.C:
      flush()
    case <-stop:
      return
    }
  }
}()

// Elsewhere...
close(stop)  // signal the goroutine to stop
<-done       // and wait for it to exit
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

There's no way to stop this goroutine.
This will run until the application exits.

</td><td>

This goroutine can be stopped with `close(stop)`,
and we can wait for it to exit with `<-done`.

</td></tr>

### Prefer Specifying Container Capacity

Specify container capacity where possible in order to allocate memory for the
container up front. This minimizes subsequent allocations (by copying and
resizing of the container) as elements are added.

#### Specifying Map Capacity Hints

Where possible, provide capacity hints when initializing
maps with `make()`.

```go
make(map[T1]T2, hint)
```

Providing a capacity hint to `make()` tries to right-size the
map at initialization time, which reduces the need for growing
the map and allocations as elements are added to the map.

Note that, unlike slices, map capacity hints do not guarantee complete,
preemptive allocation, but are used to approximate the number of hashmap buckets
required. Consequently, allocations may still occur when adding elements to the
map, even up to the specified capacity.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
files, _ := os.ReadDir("./files")

m := make(map[string]os.DirEntry)
for _, f := range files {
    m[f.Name()] = f
}
```

</td><td>

```go

files, _ := os.ReadDir("./files")

m := make(map[string]os.DirEntry, len(files))
for _, f := range files {
    m[f.Name()] = f
}
```

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

`m` is created without a size hint; the map will resize
dynamically, causing multiple allocations as it grows.

</td><td>

`m` is created with a size hint; there may be fewer
allocations at assignment time.

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

#### Specifying Slice Capacity

Where possible, provide capacity hints when initializing slices with `make()`,
particularly when appending.

```go
make([]T, length, capacity)
```

Unlike maps, slice capacity is not a hint: the compiler will allocate enough
memory for the capacity of the slice as provided to `make()`, which means that
subsequent `append()` operations will incur zero allocations (until the length
of the slice matches the capacity, after which any appends will require a resize
to hold additional elements).

### Test Tables

Table-driven tests with [subtests] can be a helpful pattern for writing tests
to avoid duplicating code when the core test logic is repetitive.

If a system under test needs to be tested against _multiple conditions_ where
certain parts of the inputs and outputs change, a table-driven test should
be used to reduce redundancy and improve readability.

Test tables make it easier to add context to error messages, reduce duplicate
logic, and add new test cases.

We follow the convention that the slice of structs is referred to as `tests`
and each test case `tt`. Further, we encourage explicating the input and output
values for each test case with `give` and `want` prefixes.

```go
tests := []struct{
  give     string
  wantHost string
  wantPort string
}{
  // ...
}

for _, tt := range tests {
  // ...
}
```

#### Avoid Unnecessary Complexity in Table Tests

Table tests can be difficult to read and maintain if the subtests contain conditional
assertions or other branching logic. Table tests should **NOT** be used whenever
there needs to be complex or conditional logic inside subtests (i.e. complex logic inside the `for` loop).

Large, complex table tests harm readability and maintainability because test readers may
have difficulty debugging test failures that occur.

Table tests like this should be split into either multiple test tables or multiple
individual `Test...` functions.

Some ideals to aim for are:

* Focus on the narrowest unit of behavior
* Minimize "test depth", and avoid conditional assertions (see below)
* Ensure that all table fields are used in all tests
* Ensure that all test logic runs for all table cases

In this context, "test depth" means "within a given test, the number of
successive assertions that require previous assertions to hold" (similar
to cyclomatic complexity).
Having "shallower" tests means that there are fewer relationships between
assertions and, more importantly, that those assertions are less likely
to be conditional by default.

Concretely, table tests can become confusing and difficult to read if they use multiple branching
pathways (e.g. `shouldError`, `expectCall`, etc.), use many `if` statements for
specific mock expectations (e.g. `shouldCallFoo`), or place functions inside the
table (e.g. `setupMocks func(*FooMock)`).

However, when testing behavior that only
changes based on changed input, it may be preferable to group similar cases
together in a table test to better illustrate how behavior changes across all inputs,
rather than splitting otherwise comparable units into separate tests
and making them harder to compare and contrast.

If the test body is short and straightforward,
it's acceptable to have a single branching pathway for success versus failure cases
with a table field like `shouldErr` to specify error expectations.

  _, err := DoComplexThing("inputY", xMock, yMock)
  assert.EqualError(t, err, "Y failed")
}
```
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

This complexity makes it more difficult to change, understand, and prove the
correctness of the test.

While there are no strict guidelines, readability and maintainability should
always be top-of-mind when deciding between Table Tests versus separate tests
for multiple inputs/outputs to a system.

#### Parallel Tests

Parallel tests, like some specialized loops (for example, those that spawn
goroutines or capture references as part of the loop body),
must take care to explicitly assign loop variables within the loop's scope to
ensure that they hold the expected values.

```go
tests := []struct{
  give string
  // ...
}{
  // ...
}

for _, tt := range tests {
  t.Run(tt.give, func(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()
    // ...
  })
}
```

In the example above, we must declare a `tt` variable scoped to the loop
iteration because of the use of `t.Parallel()` below.
If we do not do that, most or all tests will receive an unexpected value for
`tt`, or a value that changes as they're running.

<!-- TODO: Explain how to use _test packages. -->

<!-- Source: references/src/functional-option.md -->

### Functional Options

Functional options is a pattern in which you declare an opaque `Option` type
that records information in some internal struct. You accept a variadic number
of these options and act upon the full information recorded by the options on
the internal struct.

Use this pattern for optional arguments in constructors and other public APIs
that you foresee needing to expand, especially if you already have three or
more arguments on those functions.

db.Open(addr, db.DefaultCache, zap.NewNop())
db.Open(addr, db.DefaultCache, log)
db.Open(addr, false /* cache */, zap.NewNop())
db.Open(addr, false /* cache */, log)
```

Options are provided only if needed.

```go
db.Open(addr)
db.Open(addr, db.WithLogger(log))
db.Open(addr, db.WithCache(false))
db.Open(
  addr,
  db.WithCache(false),
  db.WithLogger(log),
)
```

Our suggested way of implementing this pattern is with an `Option` interface
that holds an unexported method, recording options on an unexported `options`
struct.

```go
type options struct {
  cache  bool
  logger *zap.Logger
}

type Option interface {
  apply(*options)
}

type cacheOption bool

func (c cacheOption) apply(opts *options) {
  opts.cache = bool(c)
}

func WithCache(c bool) Option {
  return cacheOption(c)
}

type loggerOption struct {
  Log *zap.Logger
}

func (l loggerOption) apply(opts *options) {
  opts.logger = l.Log
}

func WithLogger(log *zap.Logger) Option {
  return loggerOption{Log: log}
}

// Open creates a connection.
func Open(
  addr string,
  opts ...Option,
) (*Connection, error) {
  options := options{
    cache:  defaultCache,
    logger: zap.NewNop(),
  }

  for _, o := range opts {
    o.apply(&options)
  }

  // ...
}
```

Note that there's a method of implementing this pattern with closures but we
believe that the pattern above provides more flexibility for authors and is
easier to debug and test for users. In particular, it allows options to be
compared against each other in tests and mocks, versus closures where this is
impossible. Further, it lets options implement other interfaces, including
`fmt.Stringer` which allows for user-readable string representations of the
options.
